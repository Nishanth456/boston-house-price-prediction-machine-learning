## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a Boston House Price Prediction model using Machine Learning techniques. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of houses in Boston based on various features. I utilized the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to achieve an impressive accuracy of 91.29%.
